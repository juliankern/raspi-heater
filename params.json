Maybe you'll find it useful for yourself.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Time and location based temperature: at home, away, or away for holidays\r\n- Interrupt the automatic setup for 15 minutes heating\r\n- control via iOS 10 HomeKit\r\n- Display the current status on a connected LCD display\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\nRight now the software just activates a relay when the temperature gets too low. In theory it should be possible to extend it in order to support digital thermostats.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n- NodeJS 6\r\n- MongoDB\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n- checkout this repository\r\n- run `npm install`\r\n- create environment config file: \r\n    - create new file `.env`\r\n    - add the mongodb location like `MONGODB='localhost/heater'`\r\n    - you can use both a local mongodb and a server based, although i noticed that the latency is likely too high to support a proper control\r\n- Adjust `config.json` to your needs: \r\n    - Change the GPIO ports to your ones and your sensor name\r\n    - Change the desired days, times and temperatures - if no temerature is set for a status, the default temperatures will be used\r\n    - Change the locale\r\n    - If you want to use multiple raspi-heaters with the same database, give each one a different zone id\r\n- start the processes you need:\r\n    - `control.js` for the general controller\r\n    - `homekit.js` for homekit support\r\n    - `display.js` if you've connected a display\r\n    - you can start all three with the pm2 process manager with the added process.json\r\n\r\n## Future features\r\n- browser interface\r\n    - server based, with own database and replication\r\n- real support for multiple instances in the same home network\r\n",
